.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an interface to kernel component of the NPF packet filter.
.\" -----
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_sysinit "nworkers"
Initialize the NPF kernel component system.
This must be called before starting the use of
.Nm
library.
The
.Fa nworkers
parameter specifies how many worker threads should be spawned.
The workers perform such operations as connection expiration and destruction
amongst all the instances.
.Pp
Returns zero on success and the error number on failure.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_sysfini
Destroy any resources used by the
.Fm
library, e.g. stop and exit the worker threads.
This function must be called once finished using the component.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_create "mbufops" "ifops"
Construct and return a new instance of the NPF kernel component.
The paremeters
.Fa mbufops
and
.Fa ifops
specify the operation vectors, that is, structures containing the set of
functions required to operate a network buffer (mbuf) or a network interface.
This functions abstract the real representation and shall be provided by
the caller.
.Pp
Returns a reference (pointer) to the instance on success and
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_destroy "npf"
Destroy the instance of the NPF kernel compaining, freeing all resources
used by it.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_load "npf" "ref" "err"
Load a new configuration into the NPF instance.
The new configuration is specified by a
.Fa ref
parameter.
It is a reference to the configuration built by the
.Fn npf_config_build
function from the
.Xr libnpf 3
library.
.Pp
Returns zero on success and error number on failure.
In a case of failure, additionally returns extra information in a
structure specified by the
.Fa err
parameter.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_thread_register "npf"
Register a "processing context" i.e. threads which will perform the
.Fn npf_packet_handler
calls.
All threads processing the packets (invoking the handler) must register.
Failure to register may abort the program.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_packet_handler "npf" "mp" "ifp" "di"
Inspect the packet, matching and processing it against the configuration
loaded in the specified NPF instance.
This is the main routine performing packet filtering (as well as any other
operations).
.Pp
The packet is specified by the
.Fa mp
parameter.
The NPF instance may destroy the packet and set this parameter to
.Dv NULL .
This is done on block, but may also be done on other operations (e.g.
if the rule procedure decides to consume the packet).
The network interface packet is passing-through is specified by the
.Fa ifp
parameter.
The packet direction is specified by the
.Fa di
parameter and may be either
.Dv PFIL_IN
or
.Dv PFIL_OUT .
.Pp
This function returns zero if the packet was "passed" and error number
otherwise.
A regular "block" is indicated by the
.Dv ENETUNREACH
error nubmer.
.\" ---
.It Fn npf_ifmap_attach "npf" "ifp"
Attach the virtual network interface to the NPF instance.
This indicates that the packets on this interface shall be processed.
.It Fn npf_ifmap_detach "npf" "ifp"
Detach the virtual network interface from the NPF instance.
