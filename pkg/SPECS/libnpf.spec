%description
NPF is a layer 3 packet filter, supporting IPv4 and IPv6 as well as layer
4 protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP.  It was designed with a focus on
high performance, scalability and modularity.  NPF was written from
scratch in 2009.  It is written in C99 and distributed under the 2-clause
BSD license.

This RPM package is a standalone version of NPF.  It contains the libnpf
and libnpfkern libraries.
